This is a console application that simulates the basic functionality of a classifieds website. It allows users to register, log in with their username and password, and includes a feature to check for duplicate usernames during registration. Additionally, a security measure is implemented to prevent password brute-forcing: after five failed login attempts, the program notifies the user that they are locked out for five minutes and cannot attempt to log in. Once logged in, the user can create their own listings, view them, and also see listings from other users if any exist. The user can also delete their own listings one by one or all at once. There is an option to log out, so that the user can either log in with a different account or register a new user.
